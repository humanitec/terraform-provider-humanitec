# humanitec_resource_account (Resource)

Resource Accounts hold credentials that are required to provision and manage resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "humanitec_resource_account" "gcp_test" {
  id          = "gcp-dev"
  name        = "gcp-dev"
  type        = "gcp"
  credentials = "{ json from key }"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `credentials` (String, Sensitive) Credentials associated with the account.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the account (in scope of the organization it belongs to).
- `name` (String) Display name.
- `type` (String) The type of the account

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import humanitec_resource_account.example resource_account_id
```
