# humanitec_value (Resource)

Shared Values can be used to manage variables and configuration that might vary between environments. They are also the way that secrets can be stored securely.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "humanitec_value" "app_val1" {
  app_id = "example-app"

  key         = "VAL1"
  description = "app level value"
  value       = "EXAMPLE"
  is_secret   = false
}

resource "humanitec_value" "app_env_val1" {
  app_id = "example-app"
  env_id = "production"

  key         = "VAL1"
  description = "app env level value"
  value       = "EXAMPLE"
  is_secret   = false
}

# In case you want to import a secret value, but don't want the secret in your state file, you can ignore the value field.
resource "humanitec_value" "app_val1_ignore_value" {
  app_id = "example-app"

  key         = "VAL1"
  description = "app env level value"
  is_secret   = true

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      value,
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_id` (String) The ID of the Application that the Shared Value should belong to.
- `description` (String) A Human friendly description of what the Shared Value is.
- `is_secret` (Boolean) Specified that the Shared Value contains a secret.
- `key` (String) The unique key by which the Shared Value can be referenced.

### Optional

- `env_id` (String) The ID of the Environment that the Shared Value should belong to.
- `secret_ref` (Attributes) The sensitive value that will be stored in the primary organization store or a reference to a sensitive value already stored in one of the registered stores. It can't be defined if is_secret is false or value is defined. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--secret_ref))
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The value that will be stored. It can't be defined if secret_ref is defined.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--secret_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `secret_ref`

Optional:

- `ref` (String) Secret reference in the format of the target store. It can't be defined if value is defined.
- `store` (String) Secret Store id. This can't be humanitec (our internal Secret Store). It's mandatory if ref is defined and can't be used if value is defined.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) Value to store in the secret store. It can't be defined if ref is defined.
- `version` (String) Only valid if ref is defined. It's the version of the secret as defined in the target store.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# import an existing app value
terraform import humanitec_value.val1 app_id/key

# import an existing app env value
terraform import humanitec_value.val1 app_id/env_id/key
```
