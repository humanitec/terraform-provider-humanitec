# humanitec_application (Resource)

An Application is a collection of Workloads that work together. When deployed, all Workloads in an Application are deployed to the same namespace.

---
**_NOTE:_**  Version 1.7.0 removed the option to create an initial environment via the application resource. Environment creation is now fully separate and must be triggered using the [humanitec_environment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/humanitec/humanitec/latest/docs/resources/environment) resource.
To replicate the previous application resource behavior, use the example below.

---

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "humanitec_application" "example" {
  id   = "example"
  name = "An example app"
}

resource "humanitec_environment" "example" {
  app_id = humanitec_application.example.id
  id     = "development"
  name   = "Development"
  type   = "development"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID which refers to a specific application.
- `name` (String) The Human-friendly name for the Application.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import humanitec_application.example resource_application_id
```
